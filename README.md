# yes
code is unreadable
cry about it

# what it do
headers: pulls all via proxy
paths: rips links/forms
js: grabs inline scripts
leaks: hunts api keys, jwts, aws, etc
fuzz: probes /admin, /api, shit like that

# notes
proxy (server.js) dodges cors
fuzz list in script.js, add more
regex in script.js, mess with it
runs local, no cloud bs
